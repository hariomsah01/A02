Step-by-Step Tutorial for Using Git and GitHub with WebStorm
Part 1: Directions on Using WebStorm
Download and Install WebStorm:

Go to the JetBrains website and download the appropriate version of WebStorm for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions provided by JetBrains to install WebStorm on your computer.
Set Up Git on Your Computer:

If Git is not already installed on your system, download it from the official Git website and follow the installation instructions.
Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and configure Git with your name and email address:
arduino
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one):

Go to GitHub and sign up for a new account by following the instructions on the website.
Create a New Repository on GitHub:

Log in to your GitHub account and click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner.
Select "New repository" from the dropdown menu.
Give your repository a name, choose whether it should be public or private, and optionally add a description.
Click on the "Create repository" button.
Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine:

Open WebStorm and select "Get from Version Control" from the welcome screen or the VCS menu.
In the "URL" field, enter the URL of the repository you just created on GitHub.
Choose a directory on your local machine where you want to clone the repository.
Click on the "Clone" button.
Make Changes to Your Code:

Open the project in WebStorm and make changes to your code as needed.
Commit Your Changes:

In WebStorm, open the "Version Control" tool window by selecting "View" > "Tool Windows" > "Version Control" from the menu.
You will see a list of files that have been modified. Select the files you want to commit.
Enter a commit message describing the changes you made.
Click on the "Commit" button.
Push Your Changes to GitHub:

After committing your changes, click on the "Push" button in the "Version Control" tool window.
This will push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
Pull Changes from GitHub:

If you are working with others on the same repository, you may need to pull changes from GitHub before pushing your own changes.
Click on the "Pull" button in the "Version Control" tool window to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into your local branch.
Resolve Merge Conflicts (if any):

If there are any merge conflicts, WebStorm will prompt you to resolve them.
Open the affected files, resolve the conflicts, and save the changes.
After resolving conflicts, commit the changes again and push them to GitHub.


Part 2: Glossary
Branch: A parallel version of a repository that diverges from the main line of development, allowing you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.
Clone: To create a copy of a repository that exists on a remote server, such as GitHub, onto your local machine.
Commit: To save changes to your local repository along with a descriptive message explaining the changes.
Fetch: To retrieve changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch.
Git: A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
GitHub: A web-based platform used for hosting Git repositories and collaborating with others on software development projects.
Merge: To integrate changes from one branch into another branch or the main codebase.
Merge Conflict: A situation that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences between two branches during a merge operation.
Push: To upload local repository changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub.
Pull: To fetch changes from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch.
Remote: A version of a repository hosted on a server, such as GitHub, that can be accessed and manipulated by multiple users.
